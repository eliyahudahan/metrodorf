        Train heterogeneous ensemble (Al Ghamdi 2022)
        
        Delay distributions follow Bologna 2025 findings:
        • German high-speed trains (ICE): exponential distribution
        • Local trains: power-law tails (heavy tails)
        • Priority rules: lower priority → more delays
        
        External factors justified by UvA 2025:
        • Network features alone give only 0.65 BA
        • Need weather, time-of-day, events (all in our features!)
